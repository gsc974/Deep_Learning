### Projects

* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/gsc974/Deep_Learning/tree/master/project-bikesharing): Neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/gsc974/Deep_Learning/tree/master/project-dog_breed_classification_Pytorch): Convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/gsc974/Deep_Learning/tree/master/project-tv_script_generation): Recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/gsc974/Deep_Learning/tree/master/project-face-generation): DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
* [SageMaker Deployment](https://github.com/gsc974/Deep_Learning/tree/master/project-face-generation): Build and deploy a neural network which predicts the sentiment of a user-provider movie review.
