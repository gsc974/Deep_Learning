## TV Script Generation

### Install

This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pytorch 1.2.0](https://pytorch.org)

### Introduction

In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. 

The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

### Get the Data

The data is already provided for you in ```./data/Seinfeld_Scripts.txt``` and you're encouraged to open that file and look at the text.
